## Welcome to my Github userpage

I am Jonah Perez (people also call me Jon, Jonzski), a Computer Science student from University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os, who codes not so efficient yet but soon. I'm mostly self-taught in coding and prefers fullstack development. Yup, I can do both frontend and backend. 


### Programming Languages

Currently learning `C`, `C#`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Python`, `Java`, `Flutter`.
